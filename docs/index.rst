Entanglement Documentation
==========================

**Entanglement** is a state synchronization system.  It is superficially similar to database replication technologies.  Database replication focuses on quickly transmitting committed changes to a database in a consistent manner.  Entanglement focuses  on eventually synchronizing state between nodes in a network hile minimizing bandwidth.  See :ref:`Introduction` for more details.
